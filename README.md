## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- CSS Grid: first time learning about it and using it.
- Clamp: I tried using it for fonts and elements size.

Example: 

```css
.rate_item {
width: clamp(280px, 80%, 450px);
}

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 40% 10% 50%;
    grid-template-rows: 50% 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

- More practice with CSS Grid
